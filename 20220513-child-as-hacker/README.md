# The Child as Hacker

After finding Dr. Josh Tenenbaum's [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pwm6DqdC4pU) on computational cognitive science on Youtube, I became interested in this group's research and read several papers written by them. Today, I would like to share with you one of the papers that I believe clearly explains one of the directions of this group's research.

- Joshua S. Rule et al. (2020), The Child as Hackers, Trends in Cognitive Science


## Main Argument
A little background may help you better understand the main claim of this paper. As Dr. Josh Tenenbaum explains in many of his presentations, one of their goals is to create algorithms that can learn from scratch and reach human-level intelligence, just as children grow and develop intelligence. To this end, the authors of this paper are particularly interested in the developmental process of human children and plan to replicate and mimic that process in their algorithm.

To achieve this goal, the authors of this paper suggest that thinking about children's learning through the activity of hacking, the process of creating interesting code, may be beneficial for understanding the developmental process of children's learning. The authors point out that the two are similar in the following aspects

- Representation of knowledge. The object of hacking is code, but the object of learning is knowledge. Recent research suggests that both are represented by complex combinations of simple concepts.
- Learning process. If knowledge is represented by a code-like representation, then acquiring new knowledge corresponds to creating a new code.
- Purpose of learning. Learning objectives are very diverse and are not limited to a single metric. Similarly, the purpose of hacking can vary from making code faster to making code fun. Also, the main purpose of both activities is to satisfy intrinsic motivation, not to optimize a single objective.


## The case of  "sum to min transition"
To illustrate the point of the "child as hacker" concept, the famous "sum to min transition" phenomenon in children's math learning is introduced: when adding two numbers, children first represents the two numbers by raising the fingers in the same amount, then counting the fingers to compute the answer. However, it is known that as children become more familiar with addition, they gradually change to finding the minimum value of two numbers and then increasing the value by that number from the value of the other one.

This phenomenon, the authors point out, clearly demonstrates the correspondence between children's learning and hacking. In both cases, the object of manipulation is an explicit algorithm, and there is no difference in this respect. Moreover, this learning is done through iterative refinement of the algorithm, as detailed in the paper. The children improve their addition method by gradually changing one small part of the algorithm at a time, from the "sum" method to the "min" method. Again, parallels with hacking can be observed in this regard. Also, the children's learning objectives are supposed to change depending on the situation, just as hacking does.

## Comparison with other metaphors
There are many metaphors comparable to the idea of "turning children into hackers". The authors of this paper state that this idea generalizes or complements three well-known ideas
- The Child as Scientist.
- Resource rationality and the search for novelty
- Workshops and evolutionary metaphors


In particular, the authors state that the idea of the "child as scientist" has the strongest influence on the idea of the "child as hacker" and forms the basis for this idea. The difference between the child as scientist and the child as hacker is that the latter does not limit the representation of knowledge to some form of causal model, but encompasses a broader range of knowledge representation.


## Outlook
The author points out that there are many areas in which this "child as hacker" metaphor has implications for future research. In particular, they point out that the boundary area between machine learning and psychology is an important area, noting that machine learning could take advantage of findings in how children learn in psychology, and psychology could take advantage of findings in machine learning and programmatic reasoning in computer science.
