The Child as Hacker (Rearranged Note)
- The main thesis
  - The authors propose that the children's learning is similar to hacking
- Core Claim
  - The child's learning is similar to hacking in the following ways
    - Representations: knowledge of a child <-> code
    - Processes: learning <-> create new programs
    - Objectives: both consists of diverse objectives
  - Knowledge as code and learning as programming (About Representation and Processes)
    - Recent studies show that the knowledge representation is quite similar to programs.
    - Then, learning can be paralleled to program induction.
    - The comparison between learning and programming is now investigated throughly, but there are many rooms to improve.
  - From programming to hacking (About Objectives)
    - Simply optimizing single metric with limited methods are not enough for recreating hacking like activities
    - The following three components of hacking might help improve the act of learning of machines.
    - The Many values of hacking
      - There are many evaluation functions that people use to evaluate code quality
    - The many activities of hacking
      - Hackers employ diverse methods to improve code.
    - The intrinsic motivation of hacking
      - The act of hacking is intrinsically motivated

- Hacking early arithmetic (Example illustrating the idea of "child as hacker")
  - The case for consideration is 'sum to min transition'
  - It is known that children decide which objectives to use depending on the multiple decision criteria
  - Learning occurs when children find that addends are commutative, which could be inducted from many examples.
  - Moreover, children eventually find that memorizing the result of additions are faster, which also could be induced from many examples of addition.

- Hacking and Other Metaphors (Comparison to other metaphors, Figure 1(B))
  - The "child as hacker" extends the idea of "child as scientist"
    - programs corresponds to the knowledge may go beyond causal models
    - programs specifies the details of models to build
  - Resource rationality and novelity search
    - The "child as hacker" comprises these two perspective on objective of learning
    - The "child as hacker" also proposes that the objective may change constantly.
  - Workshop and evolutionary metaphors
    - The mind works more like software than hardware, here the child as hacker may be a better metaphor
    - Evolution is intentionless, while child learning is intentional.
- Prospects for a computational account of learning
  - Using the analogy produces testable hypotheses
    - children frequently change beliefs in the absence of external data
    - The mental representations usually change gradually analogous to refactoring of code
  - Machine learning and psychology will both beneft from the perspective
    - ML <- psychology: search for large space of prograam efficiently is an important problem in ML

- The main thesis
  - The authors propose that the children's learning is similar to hacking
- Hacking as a metaphor for learning in cognitive development
  - The idea of child as hacker originates from the idea of child as scientist
